# Feedback

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/GamersSyndicate/Feedback/issues/new) on this project.

We'll try to answer it as soon as we can get to it. Once we answer we'll close the issue just so we know what we've covered, but don't worry, if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/GamersSyndicate/Feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions we've answered in the past. We try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
